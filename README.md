Code for PUEO's cameras (this is the linux_camera_tool-master repo)


Here's the documentation which describes which files are important here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBIp1_93SMMb5iaDZkjRRkewjzqeZCKY6fVV7C56ZJ0/edit?usp=sharing

The take_pic2.sh script should be put on the flight computer (or lab laptop) that is sending the command to take the picture.

The other code should be on the raspberry pi, which is running the camera software.
